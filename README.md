# VR_Assignment1_Shriya_533
This assignment consists of two parts:- 
1. **Coin Detection, Segmentation, and Counting**: Computer vision techniques are used to detect, segment, and count Indian coins from an image.
2. **Panorama Creation**: Stitches multiple overlapping images into a seamless panorama.

## Requirements
To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```
Alternatively, if you are running the code in Google Colab, you can use:
```bash
!pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Running the Code
1. Place the image file (coins.png) in the working directory.
 
2. Run the script in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
 
3. The script will display intermediate steps and final results, including:
    * Original image

    * Grayscale image

    * Binary thresholding

    * Morphological transformations

    * Background and foreground detection

    * Watershed segmentation
  
    * Final image with contours drawn around detected coins
